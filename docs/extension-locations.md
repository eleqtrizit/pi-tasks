# Extension Locations

> **Security:** Extensions run with your full system permissions and can execute arbitrary code. Only install from sources you trust.

Extensions are auto-discovered from:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.pi/agent/extensions/*.ts` | Global (all projects) |
| `~/.pi/agent/extensions/*/index.ts` | Global (subdirectory) |
| `.pi/extensions/*.ts` | Project-local |
| `.pi/extensions/*/index.ts` | Project-local (subdirectory) |

Additional paths via `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "npm:@foo/bar@1.0.0",
    "git:github.com/user/repo@v1"
  ],
  "extensions": [
    "/path/to/local/extension.ts",
    "/path/to/local/extension/dir"
  ]
}
```

To share extensions via npm or git as pi packages, see [packages.md](packages.md).
